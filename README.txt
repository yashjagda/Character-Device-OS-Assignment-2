This is a partial code which till now only registers the character device in the devices list
having major number kept as 240. 

Plan-
Further on I am working to find a way to read from the struct in sched.h and make use of 
for_each macro to get the desired output in the format.
Also the user level code will be done referring the sample code given by the professor.



// FInal Submission
1) run.c contains the code for device and Makefile for the same is also there
2) test.c contains code for user level which will be compiled as gcc -0 test test.c

Everything is working except for the state conversion from number to character which i wasn't able to implement
Thankyou.
